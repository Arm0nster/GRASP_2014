This is my workspace I built for development on the Oculus Rift while working
at University of Pennsylvania's GRASP lab in the summer of 2014.

1) Add this to .bashrc:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/vrwall/REU_Summer_2014/sandbox/glew-1.10.0/lib/

2) Extract all zipped libraries to the same level directory as OculusDev.
    -These need to be cleaned and rebuilt
